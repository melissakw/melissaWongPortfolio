import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am a Full Stack Developer specialized in creating scalable software and engaging user experience. 

I have a passion for writing easy-to-understand code, creating technical documentation/ presentation and solving problems that matter.

With my background in software development and tech consulting, I have experience designing, implementing, and scaling distributed systems, cloud environments and APIs.

Some of my current projects include a serverless product management solution with AWS Lambda, risk signal management solution for an energy trading firm, and a mobile app to help healthcare professionals diagnose their psychiatric patients.

When Iâ€™m not coding you can find me listening to music and experimenting with colors on the canvas. I also started hosting virtual cooking classes (let me know if you have a recipe to share!) and sharing my tips on growing and preparing whole foods.
